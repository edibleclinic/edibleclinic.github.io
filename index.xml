      <description>As physicians who like to inject a dose of healthy scepticism to the myriad of skincare products that are on the shelves, we found ourselves researching the ingredients of every skincare product we bought before applying it on our skin. We want to share all our safer, simplified skincare routines that we&amp;rsquo;ve landed on, as well as all the skincare formulations and tips we&amp;rsquo;ve discovered along the way. Stay tuned.</description>

      <description>When should you start using anti-aging skincare? That’s a great question, and the answer you’ve probably heard before is that IT’S NEVER TOO EARLY TO START, in order to get healthy glowing skin. However, the type of anti-aging routine you adopt should be chosen based on your age. This is our suggested routine for fading blemishes, without using medicated treatments. It works for flat acne scars, post inflammatory hyperpigmentation, freckles and light coloured moles. Using natural formulations act slower than other therapies such as laser, so be patient. Remember to be consistent with this routine for 6 months to a year in order to see results.</description>

      <description>Whether it&amp;rsquo;s pesky pimples that pop up one after another, to full blown acne, there are some simple, non-medicated steps to control oily skin and help clear acne prone skin. This is not a guide on how to cure acne, because there is technically no &amp;ldquo;cure&amp;rdquo;. Instead, the key is to find the best ways to calm down irritated skin and maintain clear skin over the long term; get rid of blackheads and whiteheads faster, and get rid of acne scars and fade post inflammatory hyperpigmentation.</description>

      <title>Skincare Ingredients Decoded</title>

      <description>What are the most popular skincare ingredients?
This is the start of a series giving you the low-down on the key active ingredients popular in skincare today.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with niacinamide.
Also known as 3-Pyridine Carboxamide, niacinamide is a form of Vitamin B3.
There is no definitive clinical evidence for its efficacy as a topical ingredient in skincare. But there is some evidence to suggest an association between niacinamide and skin brightening, controlling hyperpigmentation, sebum control, rosacea and redness, inflammation, acne, fine lines, and anti-ageing in general.</description>

      <description>What are the best organic sunscreens out there, and sunscreens with a safer ingredients list? You&amp;rsquo;ve probably been told countless times to always apply sunscreen before going out during the day.
But did you know that the active ingredients that are used to give sunscreens their UV protection properties tend to be associated with potential health concerns, such as immunological toxicity or carcinogenicity.
For example, physical (mineral) sunscreens usually contain titanium dioxide and/or zinc oxide.</description>

      <title>What Not to Mix</title>
      <link>https://edibleclinic.github.io/skincare-ingredients-not-to-mix/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <guid>https://edibleclinic.github.io/skincare-ingredients-not-to-mix/</guid>
      <description>What are the skincare ingredients you should never mix? From our experience, L-ascorbic acid (the chemically active form of vitamin C) and niacinamide are a combination that not everyone knows to avoid.
This combo is a bit controversial to begin with, because there are people who claim that combining the two are fine.
What to watch out for is that it is quite easy to mix these two ingredients without even knowing it.</description>

      <title>What order should I apply my skincare?</title>
      <link>https://edibleclinic.github.io/morning-skincare-routine-evening-routine/</link>

      <description>Does the order I put on skincare matter? Firstly, as you probably know, you should layer your skincare from the thinnest to the thickest formulation. As a general rule, apply water-based formulations first, then lotions, then creams, then oils. For a step by step walk through of the skincare product you can use at each step, from cleansing through to masking to using facial oil, see our .
Chemical exfoliators are best applied before any moisturisers so that they are better absorbed into the skin.</description>
